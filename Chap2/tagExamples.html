        Here is some <strong><em>preformatted text</em></strong>
        that has been created with the "pre" element. Note that it retains the
        paragraph tab included in the <b><i>original document</i></b>.
        Also, it does not "collapse" line feeds and whte spaces.
        Often, it is easier to use preformatted text than it is to use markup to
        get the same efect. Note, however, that the default rendering of preformatted
        text isto use a monospaced Courier font. This is often a good choice
        for displaying code in a HTML document, but perhaps not a good choice for other
        kinds of text contents.
        </pre><p><center>
        <img src="../img/fuji.jpg" align="left", width="60" height="30" />Here, a small
        graphic (the whatever it is) has been inserted into
        the document using the "img" element. This text is outside
        the preformatted
        region, so the default font is different. If you look at the
        original document, you can also see that
        white       spaces and line feeds are now collapsed
        </p><p>
        Note too, that the text is now centered. The way the text is
        displayed will
        depend on how you 
        have the display window set in your browser. It may change
        when you go from full screen to a window, for example.
        </center></p><p>
        Centering is now turned off. The default text alignment is
        to the left of your screen. 
        You can change the size and color of text <font size="7" 
        color="blue"> by using the &lt;font&gt;</font>
        <font color="purple">element.</font>
